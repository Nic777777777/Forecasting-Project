Project title- Forecasting Analysis For Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) System

1) Developed a detailed ridership forecasting model for West Oakland station using Python libraries, analyzing over 365 days of hourly traffic.
2) Conducted time series analysis on 4 BART stations using Holt-winters and SARIMAX models; identified and visualized key components including actual time series, trend, seasonality, and residuals.
3) Demonstrated model proficiency by generating plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn python libraries, including raw data, trend analysis, seasonal patterns and a split of data for training and testing purposes.
4) Executed a comprehensive model evaluation, comparing Holt-Winters and SARIMAX forecasts across 4 stations, SARIMAX demonstrated superior accuracy with an 11% lower MSE than Holt-Winters, indicating a more precise forecasting capability.
5) Collaborated with a mentor for guidance, enhancing forecasting accuracy by 5% through iterative feedback
